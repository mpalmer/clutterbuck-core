This is a template git repo suitable for building a Womble-compliant gem.
If you're reading this text in a released gem, or a git repo that isn't
`gemplate`, someone needs to write some documentation.

# Installation

It's a gem:

    gem install gemplate

There's also the wonders of [the Gemfile](http://bundler.io):

    gem 'gemplate'

If you're the sturdy type that likes to run from git:

    rake install

Or, if you've eschewed the convenience of Rubygems entirely, then you
presumably know what to do already.


# Usage

Examples go here.

Hopefully that should all be fairly self-explanatory.  If not, well, there's
more detailed documentation in the auto-generated YARD docs.


# Contributing

Bug reports should be sent to the [Github issue
tracker](https://github.com/mpalmer/gemplate/issues), or
[e-mailed](mailto:theshed+gemplate@hezmatt.org).  Patches can be sent as a
Github pull request, or [e-mailed](mailto:theshed+gemplate@hezmatt.org).
